# HackMcGill Dev Team Coding Challenge

## See the Live-Site Here --> http://104.248.117.23/

Thank you for your interest in joining the Development team on HackMcGill!

As part of the application process, we've included this coding challenge that aligns with the work that will be done throughout the year on Dev team. While the challenge is optional, we'd love to see what you can do so give it a try and don't be afraid to show off!

The deadline to submit your challenge is Wed March 20 at 1:00 PM. Best of luck!

## Instructions

You have been asked to build a webpage with an email submit form, similar to what's live on [hackmcgill.com](https://hackmcgill.com). 

There are several ways to approach this challenge, you can try to tackle one you're best at or take a shot at all of them:
1. Design a mockup
2. Build a web app or static webpage
3. Write a script that stores the form data

Keep in mind that our Dev team uses MERN stack, Typescript, and SASS though you're welcome to code in what you're comfortable with. We also really value documentation.

## To submit

1. Fork this repo and commit your code
2. If you'd like, include a statement explaining what you did and how you did it
